<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Born and raised in Chicago, IL, I am the oldest of four siblings. I studied
  Pyschology in Undergrad, but always had a passion for creative design growing
  up. My interest in web design sparked when I took a Graphic Design course in
  High School. When I learned that coding skills with a focus in Front End
  Development would allow me to use design to construct webpages, I dove right
  in. I am someone who loves new challenges and learning new things. My goal is
  to contribute to projects that feed my passions while also playing a role in
  the needs of business development.
